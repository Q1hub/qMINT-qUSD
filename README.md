## What is qMINT?
qMINT is a **decentralized, feeless, over-collateralized minting protocol** on Qubic that lets anyone:
- Lock QUBIC as collateral  
- Instantly mint **qUSD** (a USD-pegged stablecoin)  
- Stay 100% exposed to QUBIC upside while having liquid USD  

**You never have to sell your QUBIC to get USD liquidity.**

## Core Features (v1)

- Minted asset: **qUSD** – 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin  
- Mint fee: **0.1% one-time** on new positions only  
- Oracle: 30-minute TWAP via Qubic computors  
- Zero gas fees – 100% feeless & instant  
- No top-ups – each new deposit creates a brand-new position  
- Full on-chain, non-custodial, immutable smart contracts  

## Simple Use Case – How It Works

1. **You deposit QUBIC**  
   → Lock ~$1,500 worth of QUBIC (150% collateral)  
   → Pay 0.1% mint fee once on the amount you want to mint e.g **1000 qUSD = $1.00 worth of QUBIC in mint fee**
   → Instantly receive **1,000 qUSD**

2. **Use your qUSD to get liquid**  
   → Pay bills, Re-invest or hold as USD  
   → Your original QUBIC stays locked and keeps rising with price

3. **When you want your QUBIC back**  
   → Burn/repay your qUSD during the open window  
   → Unlock your original QUBIC (minus fees if late)

4. **Bonus: re-invest your qubic to cover your original investment and get more liquid**  
   → Every time QUBIC pumps ≥100% → get **the oppunity re-invest easily**  
   → Keep growing your USD balance without any minting fees.

 5. **FEES**
   → There are only 2 fee's
    New positions opened that were not a re-invest are subject to .1%
    Extensions past day 30 of locking period requires .01% fee of Qubic value based on base amount recieved to stay active if not received liquidation occurs.

 6. **First 30 of locking** 
   →  Days 0-3 collateral is hard locked unable to withdraw.
   → Day 4-30 colletral is to Re-payed
in full using the qUSD minted or by if available the Re-invest feature or by intiating extensions 
   → if none of the above been applied
full position gets liquidated and you keep the full amount recieved from minting
